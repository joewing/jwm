JWM (Joe's Window Manager)
==============================================================================

JWM is a light-weight window manager for the X11 Window System.

Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build JWM you will need a C compiler (gcc works), X11, and the
"development headers" for X11 and Xlib.
If available and not disabled at compile time, JWM will also use
the following libraries:

 - cairo and librsvg2 for SVG icons and backgrounds.
 - fribidi for bi-directional text support.
 - libjpeg for JPEG icons and backgrounds.
 - libpng for PNG icons and backgrounds.
 - libXext for the shape extension.
 - libXrender for the render extension.
 - libXmu for rounded corners.
 - libXft for anti-aliased and true type fonts.
 - libXinerama for multiple head support.
 - libXpm for XPM icons and backgrounds.

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 0. For building from the git repository, run "./autogen.sh".
 1. Run "./configure --help" for configuration options.
 2. Run "./configure [options]"
 3. Run "make" to build JWM.
