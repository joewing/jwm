.SH FILES
.IP "@SYSCONF@/system.jwmrc"
The default JWM configuration file.
.IP "~/.jwmrc"
Default local configuration file. Copy the default configuration file to this
location to make user-specific changes.  See also, option \fB\-f\fP.

.SH CONFIGURATION
.B OVERVIEW
.RS
Configuration of JWM is done by editing ".jwmrc" (or the configuration
file specified with the \fB\-f\fP option).  This file is XML
making it easy to edit, either by hand or programmatically. The
example.jwmrc gives an example configuration file.
Before restarting JWM, it is a good idea to run "jwm \-p" to make
sure the configuration file is free of errors.  Otherwise you may end up
without a root menu.

bar and on the task list. Icons that are not an appropriate size will be
scaled. Square icons work best.
.P
For menu items, the icon path is searched for a match. the icon specified for
a menu item must be the exact name of the icon file with the extension.
If no match is found, a blank area will appear where the icon should appear.
