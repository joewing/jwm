For menu items, the icon path is searched for a match. the icon specified for
a menu item must be the exact name of the icon file with the extension.
If no match is found, a blank area will appear where the icon should appear.
If an icon is not specified for any menu item in a menu, no space will be
allocated for icons.
.P
Zero or more \fBIconPath\fP tags may be specified. The text of this tag is
assumed to be an absolute directory path to a directory containing XPM,
PNG, and/or JPEG icons.
When searching for icons, if multiple paths are provided, they will be
searched in order until a match is made.
Note that icon, PNG, JPEG, and XPM support are compile-time options.

Either the \fBkey\fP or \fBkeycode\fP attributes must be specified
to determine which key will cause an action. The optional
attribute, \fBmask\fP, specifies what key mask, if any, must be in effect
for the binding to match. Finally, the text of the \fBKey\fP tag is the
action to perform.
.P
One or more of the following key masks may be specified for \fBmask\fP
(see \fBxmodmap\fP(1)):
.RS
.IP \fBA\fP
The "Alt" key (mod1).
